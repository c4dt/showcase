# Showcase

something bla

Code that helps organize the labs' projects and present them nicely

## Purpose

The showcase is the first box of C4DT's Factory. Its purpose is to help labs at the IC faculty
to present their most interesting projects to potential industrial customers.

## Structure

The information regarding the IC labs and their projects is organized in YAML files as follows:

```
data
├── labs.yaml
├── LAB1
│   └── projects.yaml
├── LAB2
│   └── projects.yaml
├── ...
...
```

- `labs.yaml` contains the information on all the labs, each one indexed by an ID.
- Each `projects.yaml`, located in a subdirectory named after a lab ID, contains the information on that lab's projects.

The information is presented to the user via a small [bottle](https://bottlepy.org/) application.

## Yaml structure

A summary of the different entries found in the yaml structure. All text to be changed is written

## Run the application locally

Ensure you have the required tools to create Python virtual environments. You might need to install a specific package depending on your distribution, e.g. on Debian `python3-venv`:

```
$ sudo apt install python3-venv
```

Simply run `make`:

```
$ make
```

This will create a Python virtual environment, activate it, install the dependencies and run the showcase application.

The application listens by default on port 8080; point your browser to http://localhost:8080/.

## Run the tests

```
$ make test
```

## Run the application on a server

Assuming \$APP_PATH is the directory containing the application, the following must be setup on the server (see also the [mod_wsgi docs](https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/user-guides/virtual-environments.html#daemon-mode-single-application):

Clone the repository:

```
$ cd $APP_PATH && git clone git@github.com:c4dt/showcase.git
```

Create the Python virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```
$ cd showcase
$ make env
```

Configure an Apache virtual host for the app, containing in particular:

```
	WSGIDaemonProcess showcase user=showcase group=showcase processes=1 threads=5 python-home=$APP_PATH/showcase/venv
	WSGIScriptAlias / $APP_PATH/showcase/app.wsgi

	<Directory $APP_PATH/showcase>
		WSGIProcessGroup showcase
		WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
		Require all granted
	</Directory>
```

Restart Apache:

```
$ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```
