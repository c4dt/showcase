    After analyzing the various possibilities to replace GAEN, and
    examining the current related projects, we focused our work on
    collaborating with microG, a Free Software project dedicated to
    replacing all of GMS. This effort resulted in a way to use microG's
    contact tracing subset as a library, so that it can be bundled with
    an existing app without source code modification, and without other
    dependencies.

    We produced a version of SwissCovid that uses this approach to run on any
    phone that does not have access to Google Play services. The resulting
    application, LibreCHovid, is <a

        the F-Droid store</a>.
