    We produced a version of SwissCovid that uses this approach to run on any
    phone that does not have access to Google Play services. The resulting
    application, LibreCHovid, is <a
            href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ch.corona.tracing/">available on
        the F-Droid store</a>.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the F-Droid store has a very strict privacy policy that makes it
impossible to know how many people did install the app. However, there are comments
and suggestions by the community, which means that some people are using it.</p>
