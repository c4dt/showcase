<h2>Introduction to Blockchains</h2>

Blockchains are around for some years now, you’ve probably come across the term
multiple times. But what is a blockchain? Put simply, it’s a way to send some
virtual money without using banks or intermediaries. There is no central
authority keeping tabs on who owns what, rather, each participant validates
every monetary transaction. One of the most known and used is Bitcoin, which
uses what is called a proof-of-work to achieve that, a very energy intensive
process. It can handle around 7 transactions per second (TPS), which is not
great compared to payment systems like Visa which handles 40'000 TPS.

<h2>How AT2 is used in this Demo</h2>

In this specific case of asset transfer, one doesn’t need a “full-blockchain”,
only some simpler primitives. Here comes AT2, which allows for the same
capabilities of Bitcoin while being orders of magnitudes faster, around 10'000
TPS. By avoiding the classical proof-of-work used in other blockchains, it also
greatly reduces the total energy consumption.
