    This demonstrator illustrates how Machine Learning is used to
    train a model on known data and how it fares on new data. It describes
    the Decentralized Learning model, showing how
    training on more data improves learning, while still keeping control on
    oneâ€™s data. Finally, it shows the negative impact that faulty
    components have on distributed learning, and how using Garfield helps
    to develop applications that can tolerate them.

<p>We're actively working on this demonstrator and hope to have something
    presentable by October 2021.</p>
