  The D-Voting project allows for electronic voting without a central point of
  trust.
  It relies instead on the majority of servers to be honest during the voting
  process.
  The ballots are encrypted during the voting phase, and then shuffled to
  anonymise the results.
  When they are finally decrypted, it is not possible anymore to retrace who
  voted for what.

  In Summer 2024, the D-Voting system was used for the first time on a bigger
  scale to elect the members of the EPFL school assembly.
  A little bit over 1000 voters used the system to elect the members, and after
  the resolution of a bug discovered during the on-going voting process, the
  elections could be successfully concluded.
  Since then the system has been used multiple times for smaller elections or
  to poll the EPFL community on administrative questions.

  In 2025, the system was used successfully in the election of the school
  assembly.
