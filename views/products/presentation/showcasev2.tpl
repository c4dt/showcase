To suggest new projects to our partners, at the C4DT Factory we have a list of current and past projects from our affiliated labs. This helps us keep an overview of interesting projects and starting points for new projects. Once per year the C4DT Factory updates all projects and their description, as well as adding new projects, and removing old ones.

Over the years the interface of the showcase got more and more out of sync with the look and feel of modern UIs, so we decided to re-create the showcase to improve user experience. The goal is still to present the projects from the labs, but now we added new features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>presentation of the most important projects from our labs related to digital trust</li>
    <li>an updated view of the list of projects with a more modern UI</li>
    <li>better filters for the projects, simplifying the previous ones</li>
    <li>nicer presentation of the projects</li>
    <li>following EPFL's visual communication</li>
</ul>
<p>
We also added some tools to automatically update some of the information in the project, like the last GitHub commit. We already received a lot of feedback from our team, but if you have suggestions on how to make it even better, we're happy to hear from you.
