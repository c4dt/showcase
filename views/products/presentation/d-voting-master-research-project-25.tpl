  D-Voting is EPFL’s e-voting platform based on the DELA blockchain.
  The project started in 2021 and has been continuously developed by EPFL
  students and research software engineers.
  To improve D-Voting’s robustness, the permission management is currently being
  overhauled.
  In a first step, it has been moved from a dedicated component to the
  blockchain itself, requiring adjustments to the underlying logic of the
  permission handling.

  The project verified and integrated the functionality of the newly implemented
  permission system.
  This involved extending existing system tests; debugging issues with the
  blockchain component responsible for handling permissions; and integrating
  this new API in the front-end interface.
  A user study to explore the integration of OIDC-based authentication into
  D-Voting rounded off the project.
