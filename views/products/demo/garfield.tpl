    This project has been retired from the C4DT Factory Incubator

    We do not host this demo anymore, but you can find its code here and use
    the instructions to run it on your own computer!

    The <a href="https://factory.c4dt.org/incubator/garfield/demo/">Garfield
    Demonstrator</a> illustrates how Machine Learning is used to train a model
    on known data and how it fares on new data. It describes the Decentralized
    Learning model, showing how training on more data improves learning, while
    still keeping control on oneâ€™s data. Finally, it shows the negative impact
    that faulty components have on distributed learning, and how using Garfield
    helps to develop applications that can tolerate them.

    The following screenshot shows the start of the demonstrator. A
    wizard-style interface will let you navigate through the various steps of
    the demonstrator.
