<h3>
    This project has been retired from the C4DT Factory Incubator
</h3>
<p>
    We do not host this demo anymore, and unfortunately we cannot provide the
    source code of the project.
    If you're interested, please contact us, and we'll get you in contact
    with the original authors.</p>
<p>
  The
  <a href="https://factory.c4dt.org/incubator/at2/demo/">AT2 Demonstrator</a>
  will show you the power lying behind this technology. In a tutorial approach,
  you'll be taken through the creation of your account on the deployed test
  network. Then, you'll be able to send some assets to other accounts already
  registered there, as you would do on other distributed ledgers. To show that
  indeed AT2 is blazingly fast, the last part is a speed test where you can send
  as many transactions as you want and measure how well the network handles the
  load.
