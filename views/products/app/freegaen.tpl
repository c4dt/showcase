    We produced a version of SwissCovid that uses this approach to run on any
    phone that does not have access to Google Play services. The resulting
    application, LibreCHovid, is <a
            href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ch.corona.tracing/">available on
        the F-Droid store</a>.
</p>
<p>The F-Droid store does not provide statistics regarding how many users installed
    an app, for privacy reasons. However, comments, issue reports and feature requests by the
    community indicate that there is a demand and a user base for this version of
    SwissCovid.</p>
