<p>Lightarti was developed during the work on SwissCovid at C4DT, in collaboration with Carmela Troncoso's lab.
    It allows mobile applications to use the Tor network for low-bandwidth calls like sending telemetry data
    in an anonymous way.
    Contrary to other tor-libraries, lightarti-rest reduces bandwidth usage to a minimum, while keeping security
    and privacy to a maximum.
