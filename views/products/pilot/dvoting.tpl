The d-voting project allows for electronic voting without a central point of trust.
It relies instead on the majority of servers to be honest during the voting process.
The ballots are encrypted during the voting phase, and then shuffled to anonymise the results.
When they are finally decrypted, it is not possible anymore to retrace who voted for what.

As of September 2023, we're preparing to launch a demo of the d-voting across several instances of EPFL.
We hope to replace the current e-voting project for March 2024.
