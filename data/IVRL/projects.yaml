        description:  Efficient Superpixels
        layman_desc: >
            Superpixels, which define similar regions in an image, are becoming
            increasingly popular for use in computer vision applications. This
            research proposes a faster and more accurate way to get these pixels.

        layman_desc: >
            Fast and accurate salient-object detectors are important for various
            image processing and computer vision applications, such as adaptive
            compression and object segmentation.

        name:         Image Completion
        description:  Complete an image whose 99% pixels are randomly missing
        layman_desc: >
            It is challenging to complete an image whose 99% pixels are randomly
            missing. We present a solution to this extreme image completion
            problem.
