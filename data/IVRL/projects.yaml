    description: Efficient Superpixels
    layman_desc: >
      Superpixels, which define similar regions in an image, are becoming
      increasingly popular for use in computer vision applications. This
      research proposes a faster and more accurate way to get these pixels.

    description: Fast and energy-efficient video encoder and decoder
    layman_desc: >
      ADEFAN (Adaptive Depth Efficient Filtering by Adaptive Normaliztion) is a
      state-of-the-art technology for encoding and decoding videos that
      presents many advantages over other available methods. It features
      extremely energy-efficient encoder, extremely fast encoding process, no
      specialized hardware for encoding and added security with encoding key.
      It is this ideal for video-transmitting IoT devices, continuously
      transmitting surveillance cameras, emergency deployment in areas without
      much infrastructure (remote, natural disaster relief, etc.).

    description: Noise-robust image classification
    layman_desc: >
      Image classification has significantly improved using deep learning.
      This is mainly due to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are
      capable of learning rich feature extractors from large datasets.
      However, most deep learning classification methods are trained on clean
      images and are not robust when handling noisy ones, even if a restoration
      preprocessing step is applied.  We propose a method that can be applied
      on a pretrained classifier.  We improve the noisy-image classification
      (NIC) results by significantly large margins, especially at high noise
      levels, and come close to the fully retrained approaches.

    description: Deep learning image denoiser
    layman_desc: >
      Blind and universal image denoising consists of using a unique model that
      denoises images with any level of noise. It is especially practical as
      noise levels do not need to be known when the model is developed or at
      test time. We propose a blind and universal deep learning image denoiser
      based on an optimal denoising solution, which we call fusion denoising.
      Our approach improves real-world grayscale additive image denoising. It
      also improves state-of-the-art color image denoising performance on every
      single noise level by an average of 0.1dB.

    description: High-quality image fusion
    layman_desc: >
      Medical image fusion plays a central role by integrating information from
      multiple sources into a single, more understandable output. We propose a
      real-time image fusion method using pre-trained neural networks to
      generate a single image containing features from multi-modal sources.
      Our method can be applied to any number of input sources.

    description: Interactive GAN-based image editing
    layman_desc: >
      When generating an image using a GAN, some errors might appear which are
      obvious to the human observer, but not to the computer.
      By introducing this user feedback one can refine the generated image
      to look even more real.
