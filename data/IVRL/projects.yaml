    description: Efficient Superpixels
    layman_desc: >
      Superpixels, which define similar regions in an image, are becoming
      increasingly popular for use in computer vision applications. This
      research proposes a faster and more accurate way to get these pixels.

    description: Complete an image whose 99% pixels are randomly missing
    layman_desc: >
      It is challenging to complete an image whose 99% pixels are randomly
      missing. We present a solution to this extreme image completion
      problem.
