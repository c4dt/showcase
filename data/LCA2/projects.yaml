        description:  IP Parallel Redundancy Protocol
        layman_desc: >
            IPRP allows parallel transmission of data over a network for hard
            real time applications with simply installing an app on both the
            server and the client.

        layman_desc: >
            This project defines a message format, based on Cap'n Proto, for
            encoding certain mathematical objects (i.e., real-valued symbolic
            expressions, sets and set-valued functions) as sequences of bytes.

          T-RECS is a software testbed for multi-agent real-time control of electric grids. T-RECS uses
          software containers to run each agent in a virtual environment. Agents are networked via Mininet,
          so real packets are exchanged using TCP/IP.
