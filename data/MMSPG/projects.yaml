    description: Crowdsourcing image quality assessment
    layman_desc: >
      Video quality assessment with subjective testing is both time
      consuming and expensive. An interesting new approach to traditional
      testing is the so-called crowdsourcing, moving the testing effort
      into the internet. QualityCrowd allows to perform subjective quality
      assessment with crowdsourcing. QualityCrowd allows codec independent
      quality assessment with a simple web interface, usable with common
      web browsers.

      The renderer supports visualization of point clouds with real-time
      interaction, while viewing conditions can be configured. The user
      is able to choose between either an adaptive, or a fixed splat size
      rendering mode in order to display the models. The renderer supports
      both PLY and PCD point cloud file formats. The current settings have
      been optimized for voxelized contents, without this limiting its
      usage, since any point cloud can be displayed independently of its
      geometric structure.

    description: Learning residual coding for point clouds
    layman_desc: >
    tech_desc: >
      Recent  advancements  in  acquisition  of  three-dimensional  models have
      been  increasingly  drawing  attention  toimaging modalities based on the
      plenoptic representations, such as light fields and point clouds.  Since
      point cloudmodels can often contain millions of points, each including
      both geometric positions and associated attributes,efficient compression
      schemes are needed to enable transmission and storage of this type of
      media. This project presents a detachable learning-based residual module
      for point cloud compression that allows for efficientscalable coding.

    description: Correctly re-identify people in different images
    layman_desc: >
      In person re-identification, people must to be correctly identified in
      images that come from different cameras or are captured at different
      points in time. In the open-set case, the above needs be achieved for
      persons that have not been previously observed. We propose a universal
      method for building a multi-shot gallery of observed reference identities
      recurrently online.
