    description: Crowdsourcing image quality assessment
    layman_desc: >
      Video quality assessment with subjective testing is both time
      consuming and expensive. An interesting new approach to traditional
      testing is the so-called crowdsourcing, moving the testing effort
      into the internet. QualityCrowd allows to perform subjective quality
      assessment with crowdsourcing. QualityCrowd allows codec independent
      quality assessment with a simple web interface, usable with common
      web browsers.

    description: Show point cloud files using three.js
    tech_desc: >
      The renderer supports visualization of point clouds with real-time
      interaction, while viewing conditions can be configured. The user
      is able to choose between either an adaptive, or a fixed splat size
      rendering mode in order to display the models. The renderer supports
      both PLY and PCD point cloud file formats. The current settings have
      been optimized for voxelized contents, without this limiting its
      usage, since any point cloud can be displayed independently of its
      geometric structure.
