        description: Formally verified and performant software Middleboxes
        tech_desc: >
            Software stack and toolchain for building and running software
            middleboxes that are guaranteed to be correct, while providing
            competitive performance and preserving developer productivity. With
            Vigor, developers write the middlebox code (i.e., the software
            network function, or NF) in C atop a standard packet-processing
            framework, putting persistent state in data structures from a
            Vigor-provided library. Vigor then automatically verifies that the
            resulting software stack correctly implements a specification
            (written in Python).

        name: Bolt
        description: Performance Contracts for Software Network Functions
        tech_desc: >
          In this work, we propose the notion of performance contracts for NFs. A performance
          contract enables users to predict and scrutinize NF performance at fine granularities
          without having to run them. It provides users with an abstraction that enables them
          to easily parameterize arbitrary input workloads, whether typical, exceptional or
          adversarial.

        description: Fast and precise control-flow hijack protection
        tech_desc: >
          Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) is a property of C/C++ programs that guarantees absence
          of control-flow hijack attacks by requiring integrity of all direct and indirect
          pointers to code. Code-Pointer Separation (CPS) is a simplified version of CPI that
          provides strong protection against such attacks in practice. SafeStack is a component
          of CPI/CPS, which can be used independently and protects against stack-based
          control-flow hijacks.

            S²E is a platform for writing tools that analyze the properties and
            behavior of software systems. S²E comes as a modular library that
            gives virtual machines symbolic execution and program analysis
            capabilities.

        layman_desc: >
            Failure sketching is an automated debugging technique that provides
            developers with an explanation (“failure sketch”) of the root cause
            of a failure that occurred in production. A failure sketch only
            contains program statements that lead to the failure, and it clearly
            shows the differences between failing and successful runs; these
            differences guide developers to the root cause.
