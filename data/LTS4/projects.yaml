        description:  Geometry-inspired sparse attack on deep networks
        layman_desc: >
            Deep Neural Networks have achieved extraordinary results on image
            classification tasks, but have been shown to be vulnerable to attacks
            with carefully crafted perturbations of the input data. Although most
            attacks usually change values of many imageâ€™s pixels, it has been
            shown that deep networks are also vulnerable to sparse alterations
            of the input.
            SparseFool implements an efficient algorithm to compute and control
            sparse alterations.
