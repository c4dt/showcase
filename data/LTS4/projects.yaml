        description:  Geometry-inspired sparse attack on deep networks
        layman_desc: >
            Deep Neural Networks have achieved extraordinary results on image
            classification tasks, but have been shown to be vulnerable to attacks
            with carefully crafted perturbations of the input data. Although most
            attacks usually change values of many image’s pixels, it has been
            shown that deep networks are also vulnerable to sparse alterations
            of the input.
            SparseFool implements an efficient algorithm to compute and control
            sparse alterations.

        layman_desc: >
            Neural Networks need to be trained with a lot of examples. If an
            adversary can include samples, he can change the decisions the
            Neural Network will be doing. Another attack choses carefully crafted
            images to make the Neural Network change the decision. This can lead
            to a misinterpretation of a STOP signal as a signal indicating the speed.
