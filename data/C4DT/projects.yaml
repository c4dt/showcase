    description: A hands-on workshop showing how cryptography can preserve privacy and security of an E-ID solution.
    tech_desc: >
      To protect the privacy of the users of E-ID systems, several technical measures need to be taken.
      This workshop demonstrates the workings of Self-Sovereign Identities, using selective disclosure 
      for data protection, and explores further safeguards like unlinkability through BBS+ and 
      zero-knowledge proofs to share only essential information.

      Phishing is a growing societal threat and requires urgent, effective solutions. Through a collaborative process
      involving field feedback, ideation workshops, and state-of-the-art analysis, this open innovation project will
      explore technical, organizational, and legal solutions. The results will be prototypes, practical guidelines,
      and recommendations to strengthen digital security against phishing.

      Matrix is a widely used open source chat platform. It is an alternative to platforms such as Slack and MSTeams.
      Edward Andò from the Imaging Center at EPFL started an EPFL-wide instance, matrix.epfl.ch, in 2023. It advances
      digital trust at the whole EPFL while also having a broader positive impact.
      Thinking ahead and planning to eventually move the users of matrix.c4dt.org to this EPFL-wide instance, C4DT
      reached out to Edward Andò to offer our support bolstering matrix.epfl.ch’s team, which was readily welcomed.
