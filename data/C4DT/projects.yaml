    description: A hands-on workshop showing how cryptography can preserve privacy and security of an E-ID solution.
    tech_desc: >
      To protect the privacy of the users of E-ID systems, several technical measures need to be taken.
      This workshop demonstrates the workings of Self-Sovereign Identities, using selective disclosure 
      for data protection, and explores further safeguards like unlinkability through BBS+ and 
      zero-knowledge proofs to share only essential information.
