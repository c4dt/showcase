    description: A hands-on workshop showing how cryptography can preserve privacy and security of an E-ID solution.
    tech_desc: >
      To protect the privacy of the users of E-ID systems, several technical measures need to be taken.
      This workshop demonstrates the workings of Self-Sovereign Identities, using selective disclosure 
      for data protection, and explores further safeguards like unlinkability through BBS+ and 
      zero-knowledge proofs to share only essential information.

    layman_desc: >
      Phishing is a growing societal threat and requires urgent, effective solutions. Through a collaborative process
      involving field feedback, ideation workshops, and state-of-the-art analysis, this open innovation project will
      explore technical, organizational, and legal solutions. The results will be prototypes, practical guidelines,
      and recommendations to strengthen digital security against phishing.

      The Matrix server run for the EPFL community by the EPFL Center for Imaging with help from the EPFL
      Center for Digital Trust.
    layman_desc: >
      Matrix is a widely used open source chat platform. It is an alternative to platforms such as Slack and MSTeams.
      Edward Andò from the Imaging Center at EPFL started an EPFL-wide instance, matrix.epfl.ch, in 2023. It advances
      digital trust at the whole EPFL while also having a broader positive impact.
      Thinking ahead and planning to eventually move the users of matrix.c4dt.org to this EPFL-wide instance, C4DT
      reached out to Edward Andò to offer our support bolstering matrix.epfl.ch’s team, which was readily welcomed.
