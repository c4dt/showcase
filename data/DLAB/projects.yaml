    description: Privacy-preserving classification
    layman_desc: >
      Today, large amounts of valuable data are distributed among millions of
      user-held devices, such as personal computers, phones, or
      Internet-of-things devices. Many companies collect such data with the
      goal of using it for training machine learning models allowingthem to
      improve their services. User-held data is, however, often sensitive, and
      collecting it is problematic in terms of privacy.  We propose a novel way
      of training a supervised classifier in a distributed setting akin to the
      recently proposed federated learning paradigm, but under the stricter
      privacy requirement that the server that trains the model is assumed to
      be untrusted and potentially malicious. We thus preserve user privacy by
      design, rather than by trust.

    description: Invariant natural language modeling
    layman_desc: >
      Modern pretrained language models are critical components for natural
      language processing. Yet, they suffer from spurious correlations, poor
      out-of-domain generalization, and biases. This is a framework to learn
      invariant representations that should generalize across training
      environments.

    description: Improved entity linking
    layman_desc: >
      In natural language processing, entity linking, i.e. the task of
      assigning a unique identity to entities (for example "Paris" in a
      sentence refers to the city, not to someone's name), is an important
      problem. Most previous solutions rely on annotated data, which is however
      not available in many domains. We propose a method for entity linking
      without the need for annotated data.
