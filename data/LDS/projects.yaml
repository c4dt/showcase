        description: CRT-accelerated lattice-based cryptography library in Golang
        tech_desc: >
            Toolbox of lattice-based cryptographic primitives for Go implementing
            the BFV and CKKS schemes and their distributed version.
            The library is still at an experimental stage and should be used for
            research purposes only.

            Homomorphic encryption refers to cryptographic schemes that allow to
            compute directly on the encrypted data, without requiring the data to
            be decrypted first. It therefore enables a set of operations
            (polynomial evaluation and approximations of non-polynomial
            functions) to be "blindly" performed by an untrustworthy party on
            encrypted sensitive data, with a controlled computational overhead.
            This technology is very promising as an enabler for secure data
            sharing, and in particular, in the case of secure multi-party
            computations, where several entities want to collaboratively compute
            a function on their confidential or sensitive data, without revealing
            to each other anything else than the result of this computation.

        description:  Decentralized, Secure, Verifiable System for Statistical Queries and Machine Learning on Distributed Datasets
        layman_desc: >
            Drynx allows to create privacy-preserving queries on encrypted
            datasets that are stored at different data providers who don't
            want to share the original data. 
            Different types of statistical queries are possible, like average,
            standard deviation, linear and logistic regressions - all using
            homomorphic encryption, which means that the data is never shared
            in cleartext.
