        description: A lattice-based multiparty homomorphic encryption library in Go
        tech_desc: >
            Lattigo is a Go module for Multiparty Homomorphic Encryption, that implements
            Ring-Learning-With-Errors-based homomorphic encryption primitives. It comprises
            highly-efficient RNS versions of the BFV and CKKS schemes and their multiparty 
            (N-out-of-N-threshold) counterparts. It also implements a dense-key and 
            sparse-key Bootstrapping procedure for RNS-CKKS.
        layman_desc: >
            Homomorphic encryption (HE) comprises a special class of cryptographic 
            schemes that enable computing directly on encrypted data, without requiring 
            the data to be decrypted first. It therefore enables a set of operations 
            (polynomial evaluation and approximations of non-polynomial functions) to 
            be "blindly" performed on encrypted sensitive data by an untrustworthy party, 
            with a controlled computational overhead. Lattigo implements HE and its 
            multiparty extension (MHE), that enables several entities to collaboratively
            compute a function on their confidential or sensitive data, without revealing
            to each other anything besides the result of this computation. Lattigo's 
            multiparty homomorphic encryption technology is an enabler for secure data
            sharing in multiple scenarios.

            Drynx allows to create privacy-preserving queries on encrypted
            datasets that are stored at different data providers who don't
            want to share the original data. 
            Different types of statistical queries are possible, like average,
            standard deviation, linear and logistic regressions - all using
            homomorphic encryption, which means that the data is never shared
            in cleartext.
