        description:  Machine Learning framework to search a database via similarity samples
        layman_desc: >
            Use machine learning to organize a collection of objects (e.g. faces
            of actors) so as to make them interactively searchable via similarity
            queries.
            The approach combines concepts from representation learning,
            reinforcement learing, discrete-choice theory and bayesian inference.

        layman_desc: >
            Kickscore can be used to understand & visualize the skill of
            players (or teams) competing in pairwise matches, and to predict
            outcomes of future matches. It extends the Elo rating system and
            TrueSkill.

        description:    Predictions about votes in Switzerland
        layman_desc: >
            Predikon provide predictions about votes in Switzerland, as soon as
            municipal results are published by Swiss cantons starting at 12:00
            pm on the day of a vote.
        tech_desc:
            We designed a predictive model of the municipal results (in
            percentage of "yes") for Swiss votes. Based on past results, our
            model automatically learns features of municipalities. On the day
            of a vote, and as soon as some municipalities publish their results
            (their percentage of "yes"), our model uses the features to predict
            the unpublished results of other municipalities. The prediction of
            the national vote result is obtained by aggregating published
            results and predicted results.
