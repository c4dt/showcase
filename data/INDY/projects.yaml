        description:  Machine Learning framework to search a database via similarity samples
        layman_desc: >
            Use machine learning to organize a collection of objects (e.g. faces
            of actors) so as to make them interactively searchable via similarity
            queries.
            The approach combines concepts from representation learning,
            reinforcement learing, discrete-choice theory and bayesian inference.
