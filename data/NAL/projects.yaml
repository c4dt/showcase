      Performance Contracts for Software Network Functions
    tech_desc: >
      The goal of our work is to provide network operators and NF developers with comprehensive understanding of
      the NFâ€™s entire performance profile, before it is deployed. Such understanding would, for instance, allow
      operators to conduct precise capacity planning and developers to make informed development decisions.

    description: Formally verified and performant software Middleboxes
    tech_desc: >
      Software stack and toolchain for building and running software
      middleboxes that are guaranteed to be correct, while providing
      competitive performance and preserving developer productivity. With
      Vigor, developers write the middlebox code (i.e., the software
      network function, or NF) in C atop a standard packet-processing
      framework, putting persistent state in data structures from a
      Vigor-provided library. Vigor then automatically verifies that the
      resulting software stack correctly implements a specification
      (written in Python).
