            Performance Contracts for Software Network Functions
        tech_desc: >
             The goal of our work is to provide network operators and NF developers with comprehensive understanding of
             the NFâ€™s entire performance profile, before it is deployed. Such understanding would, for instance, allow
             operators to conduct precise capacity planning and developers to make informed development decisions.
