      Performance Contracts for Software Network Functions
    layman_desc: >
      Software network functions (NFs), or middleboxes, promise flexibility and
      easy deployment of network services but face the serious challenge of
      unexpected performance behaviour. This behaviour makes it harder for
      network operators to provision their networks and exposes a new attack
      surface for adversaries seeking to degrade network performance.
      The goal of our work is to provide network operators and NF developers
      with comprehensive understanding of the NFâ€™s entire performance profile,
      before it is deployed. Such understanding would, for instance, allow
      operators to conduct precise capacity planning and developers to make
      informed development decisions.
    tech_desc: >
      We propose the notion of performance contracts for NFs. A performance
      contract enables users to predict and scrutinize NF performance at fine
      granularities without having to run them. It provider users with an
      abstraction that enables them to easily parameterize arbitrary input
      workloads, whether typical, exceptional or adversarial. Given only this
      abstract description of the workload and not a concrete instance, the
      contract predicts the performance of the NF without actually running it.
      The performance predictions are in terms of human-readable formulae,
      expressed as a function of workload and environment variables, that we
      together call Performance Critical Variables (PCVs).
      informed development decisions.

    description: Formally verified and performant software Middleboxes
    tech_desc: >
      Software stack and toolchain for building and running software
      middleboxes that are guaranteed to be correct, while providing
      competitive performance and preserving developer productivity. With
      Vigor, developers write the middlebox code (i.e., the software
      network function, or NF) in C atop a standard packet-processing
      framework, putting persistent state in data structures from a
      Vigor-provided library. Vigor then automatically verifies that the
      resulting software stack correctly implements a specification
      (written in Python).
