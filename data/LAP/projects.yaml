    description: High-level synthesis compiler
    layman_desc: >
      Dynamatic is an academic, open-source high-level synthesis compiler that
      produces synchronous dynamically-scheduled circuits from C/C++ code. It
      delivers significant performance improvements compared to
      state-of-the-art commercial tools in specific situations.
