    description: Privacy assistant for installing third party cloud apps
    tech_desc: >
      When installing third party apps for cloud services such as Google Drive or DropBox, PrivySeal compares the required permissions to
      the ones actually needed, and informs users about the data-driven insights that these apps can make about them (e.g. topics of
      interest, activity patterns, etc.). The goal is to make users aware of these facts and discourage them to install over-privileged
      apps.

    tech_desc: >
      Machine Learning classifiers and tools to help with the detection of specific risks and threats children are facing while using their
      newly acquired phones. The classifiers perform on par or better than what exists on the market, and have been adapted to run smoothly
      on a mobile phone. The analysis can therefore run on the mobile phone without having to send any content to any server.
