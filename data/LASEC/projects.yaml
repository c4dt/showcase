    description: Ethereum smart contracts with secret parameters
    tech_desc: >
      By design, smart contractsâ€™ data and computations are public to all participants. Offchainer helps to create smart contracts with
      parameters that need to stay secret. We propose a way to keep some of the parameters off-chain, while guaranteeing correctness of the
      computation, using a combination of a commitment scheme and a zero-knowledge proof system.

      This project develops a system for anonymous digital tokens that can't be
      transferred between users. It allows users to obtain and use tokens privately,
      while preventing sharing or selling of tokens. The system ensures accountability
      by tying tokens to a user's secret key, without revealing the user's identity.
    tech_desc: >
      We developed techniques for building up anonymous tokens. 
      NTAT is non-transferable in the sense that a client who received an 
      anonymous voucher from an issuer cannot sell 
      it to another client without leaving a valuable secret with it.
