    description: Thermal simulator for stacked integrated circuits
    layman_desc: >
      Hardware is getting smaller every day, components are being stacked on top of each other, in order to make theses more compact. But as
      it is getting smaller, it's also getting hotter. 3D-ICE helps in modelling how thermal flux are behaving.
