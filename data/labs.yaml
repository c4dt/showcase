      The DEDIS team is working on projects related to large-scale collective
      authorities (cothorities), which distribute trust among a number of
      independent parties to allow scalable self-organizing communities.
      With no single trusted party, cothorities can secure software updates,
      provide public randomness, enable privacy-conscious medical-data sharing
      and a lot more.
      Other projects include communicating securely over insecure channels and
      fast, scalable, accountable anonymous communication.

      Our research aims to make sense of large amounts of data. Frequently, the
      data we analyze is collected on the Web, e.g., using server logs, social
      media, wikis, online news, online games, etc. We distill heaps of raw
      data into meaningful insights by developing and applying algorithms and
      techniques in areas including social and information network analysis,
      machine learning, computational social science, data mining, natural
      language processing, and human computation.

      Our research focuses on software and systems security. Despite efforts
      and improvements in bug discovery techniques, some exploitable
      vulnerabilities will remain. We target techniques that both enable
      developers to discover and remove bugs and make programs resilient
      against the exploitation of unknown or unpatched vulnerabilities.
      <ul>
        <li>
          To discover bugs we propose (i) sanitization techniques that enforce
          a security property such as memory or type safety; given concrete
          program input, our sanitizers then flag any property violations
      </li>
      <li>
        (ii) fuzzing techniques that leverage static and dynamic analysis to
        create program inputs to explore program areas that are not yet covered
        through existing test cases. To protect against exploitable
        vulnerabilities, we focus on control-flow integrity using specific
        language semantics, enforcing type integrity, and protecting selective
        data. Under this premise, we focus on compiler-based, runtime-based, and
        language-based protection mechanisms and security policies that increase
        the resilience of applications against attacks (in the presence of
        software vulnerabilities). All prototypes are released as open-source.

      Today, we experience an unprecedented integration of previously
      disconnected systems. Consequently, there is a leap in the complexity of
      the software controlling these systems. The challenge we are facing is
      how to master this complexity while at the same time increasing the
      reliability of programs. A key element for tackling that challenge will
      be a better understanding of software composition. Good techniques for
      software composition are the keys to scalable systems. The principal
      means of writing and composing software is a programming language.
      Consequently, advances in programming language design are an important
      factor in solutions of the software composition problem. This is what we
      work on in our group.

      The Parallel System Architecture Lab senses that information technology
      has undergone a major paradigm shift with sensors, embedded and mobile
      devices generating massive amounts of data to be augmented with backend
      cloud services for enhanced experience. Data has emerged as a currency for
      modern society. Datacenters are now the backbone of IT offering
      large-scale cloud services at low costs benefiting from and exploiting the
      economies of scale. With silicon efficiency scaling having dwindled since
      2004 and silicon density scaling slowing down, future digital platforms
      will rely on heterogeneous logic and memory to allow for IT scalability.
      Meanwhile, the demand for large-scale cloud services has grown dramatically
      faster than conventional silicon scaling making IT platform scalability a
      grand challenge. Future platforms will need hand-in-hand collaboration of
      application domain experts and platform designers to improve scalability.
      With many online services being in-memory and the minimum communication
      latency between the farthest nodes in a 20MW datacenter being microseconds,
      future server platforms will go through revolutionary changes in architecture
      to enable seamless aggregation of logic and memory resources across nodes, breaking
      the conventional system abstraction layers.
