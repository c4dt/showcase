  threshold-logical-clocks:
    name: Threshold Logical Clocks
    description: Solving the consensus problem in a new way by creating a global clock
    tech_desc: >
      An attempt to simplify asynchronous consensus by building atop a novel
      threshold logical clock abstraction, which enables upper layers to
      operate as if on a synchronous network. This approach yields an
      asynchronous consensus protocol for fail-stop nodes that may be simpler
      and more robust than Paxos and its leader-based variants, requiring no
      common coins and achieving consensus in a constant expected number of
      rounds.
