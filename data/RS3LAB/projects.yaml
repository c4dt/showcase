    description: Memory allocation preventing "use-after-free" exploits
    layman_desc: >
      ffmalloc is a "one time allocator" where any given virtual memory address
      is only returned to the calling application once. Since exploitation of
      use-after-free errors relies on being able to modify memory associated
      with "dangling pointers," by not reusing a virtual address region in
      subsequent allocation, an adversary cannot negatively impact the dangling
      memory region.

    description: Efficient Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) access
    layman_desc: >
      Non-Volatile Memory (NVM), which provides relatively fast and
      byte-addressable persistence, is now commercially available. However, we
      cannot equate a real NVM with a slow DRAM, as it is much more complicated
      than we expect. We propose guidelines for designing high-performance
      persistent index structures, allowing to increase performance and tail
      latency.

    description: OS kernel with safer approach to synchronization
    layman_desc: >
      NrOS is an operating system primarily constructed as a simple, sequential
      kernel with no concurrency, making it easier to develop and reason
      aboutits correctness.
