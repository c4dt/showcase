    description: Memory allocation preventing "use-after-free" exploits
    layman_desc: >
      ffmalloc is a "one time allocator" where any given virtual memory address
      is only returned to the calling application once. Since exploitation of
      use-after-free errors relies on being able to modify memory associated
      with "dangling pointers," by not reusing a virtual address region in
      subsequent allocation, an adversary cannot negatively impact the dangling
      memory region.

    description: Efficient Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) access
    layman_desc: >
      Non-Volatile Memory (NVM), which provides relatively fast and
      byte-addressable persistence, is now commercially available. However, we
      cannot equate a real NVM with a slow DRAM, as it is much more complicated
      than we expect. We propose guidelines for designing high-performance
      persistent index structures, allowing to increase performance and tail
      latency.

    description: Application-Informed Kernel Synchronization Primitives
    tech_desc: >
      SynCord is a framework to modify kernel locks
      without recompiling or rebooting the kernel.
      It abstracts key behaviors of kernel locks and exposes them as APIs
      for designing user-defined kernel locks.
      SynCord provides the mechanisms to customize kernel locks
      safely and correctly from userspace.

    description: Scaling PM Performance with Opportunistic Delegation
    tech_desc: >
      Odinfs is a NUMA-aware PM file system based on an opportunistic delegation framework
      to achieve datapath scalability.
      It limits concurrent PM access to avoid performance meltdown due to on-DIMM cache trashing.
      It localizes PM access to avoid performance meltdown due to remote PM access.
      It automatically parallelizes large PM access to utilize cumulative PM bandwidth across all NUMA nodes.
      It maximizes concurrent access within the same file with scalable synchronization primitives.

    description: Scalable and Practical Locking with Shuffling
    tech_desc: >
      ShflLocks are a family of locking protocols that use shuffling mechanisms
      to implement several policies, such as NUMA-awareness, or blocking.
      It implements three locking protocols, NUMA-aware spinlock, NUMA-aware blocking mutex,
      and NUMA-aware blocking rwlock.
