    description: Privacy evaluation framework for synthetic data publishing
    layman_desc: >
      The framework implemented in this library allows data holders to evaluate
      how much publishing a synthetic dataset in place of a sensitive raw
      dataset reduces the privacy risk for the individuals whose data is
      included in the raw data. The results of the evaluation help to inform
      decisions about whether to publish the data or which generative model
      provides the best trade-off between utility and privacy gain.
    tech_desc: >
      The framework implemented in this library measures the privacy gain of
      publishing a synthetic dataset in place of the raw data with respect to a
      specific privacy concern. Each concern is modelled as a privacy adversary
      that targets an individual record and aims to infer a secret about this
      record. The library includes implementations of two new privacy attacks
      on the output of a generative model. To evaluate privacy gain, the
      framework is instantiated under the chosen threat model and outputs an
      estimate about how much publishing the synthetic data instead of the raw
      data reduces the privacy loss of a chosen target record under this threat
      model.

      Investigative journalists collect large numbers of digital documents
