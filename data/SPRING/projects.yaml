    name: Synthetic data privacy evaluation
    description: Implementation of a privacy evaluation framework for synthetic data releases
    layman_desc: >
      The framework implemented in this library allows data holders to evaluate how much publishing a synthetic
      dataset in-place of a sensitive raw dataset reduces the privacy risk for the individuals whose data is included
      in the raw data. The results of the evaluation help to inform decisions about whether to publish the data or
      which generative model provides the best trade-off between utility and privacy gain.
    tech_desc: >
      The framework implemented in this library measures the privacy gain of publishing a synthetic dataset
      in-place of the raw data with respect to a specific privacy concern. Each concern is modelled as a privacy
      adversary that targets an individual record and aims to infer a secret about this record. The library
      includes implementations of two new privacy attacks on the output of a generative model. To evaluate privacy
      gain, the framework is instantiated under the chosen threat model and outputs an estimate about how much
      publishing the synthetic data instead of the raw data reduces the privacy loss of a chosen target record
      under this threat model.

      A Javascript library for browsers for anonymous communication via the
      Tor network. The library connects to the Tor network to enable
      websites to send and retrieve data anonymously (e.g. send sensitive
      information without identifying the user) without requiring users to
      install special software such as the Tor browser.

      Trickster allows to attack machine learning models where the attack
      needs to be more sophisticated than simply adding some noise to an
      image. One example is to evade an abuse detection model, for example,
      social media bot detection, or a malware detector.

      The goal of the DP3T protocol is to simplify and accelerate the process of identifying people who have been
      in contact with a positively CoVid-19 tested person, thus providing a technological foundation to help

      These are attacks against privacy of the training data. In MIA, an attacker tries to guess whether a given
      example was used during training of a target model or not, only by querying the model. See more in the paper
      by Shokri et al. Currently, you can use the library to evaluate the robustness of your Keras or PyTorch models
      to MIA.
