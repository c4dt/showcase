        description:  Anonymous communication in browsers via the Tor network
        layman_desc: >
            A Javascript library for browsers for anonymous communication via the
            Tor network. The library connects to the Tor network to enable
            websites to send and retrieve data anonymously (e.g. send sensitive
            information without identifying the user) without requiring users to
            install special software such as the Tor browser.

        layman_desc: >
            Trickster allows to attack machine learning models where the attack
            needs to be more sophisticated than simply adding some noise to an
            image. One example is to evade an abuse detection model, for example,
            social media bot detection, or a malware detector.

        layman_desc: >
            The C4DT Factory team helped the SwissCovid effort by providing technical specifications to the already written code.
            In addition, we reviewed the code, and helped Ubique to use github in a more Open Source respecting way.
            We also looked at forks of the SwissCovid app to make sure that the new implementations follow the best practices.
