        description: decentralized linear ML
        tech_desc: >
            Decentralized machine learning is a promising emerging paradigm in view of global challenges of data
            ownership and privacy. We consider learning of linear classification and regression models, in the
            setting where the training data is decentralized over many user devices, and the learning algorithm
            must run on-device, on an arbitrary communication network, without a central coordinator. We propose
            COLA, a new decentralized training algorithm with strong theoretical guarantees and superior practical
            performance. Our framework overcomes many limitations of existing methods, and achieves communication
            efficiency, scalability, elasticity as well as resilience to changes in data and participating devices.

    mlbench:
        name: mlBench
        description: benchmarking of distributed ML
        layman_desc: >
            Framework for distributed machine learning. Its purpose is to
            improve transparency, reproducibility, robustness, and to provide
            fair performance measures as well as reference implementations,
            helping adoption of distributed machine learning methods both in
            industry and in the academic community.
