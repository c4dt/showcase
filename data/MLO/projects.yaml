    description: decentralized linear ML
    tech_desc: >
      Decentralized machine learning is a promising emerging paradigm in view of global challenges of data
      ownership and privacy. We consider learning of linear classification and regression models, in the
      setting where the training data is decentralized over many user devices, and the learning algorithm
      must run on-device, on an arbitrary communication network, without a central coordinator. We propose
      COLA, a new decentralized training algorithm with strong theoretical guarantees and superior practical
      performance. Our framework overcomes many limitations of existing methods, and achieves communication
      efficiency, scalability, elasticity as well as resilience to changes in data and participating devices.
