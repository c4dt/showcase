        description: decentralized linear ML
        tech_desc: >
            Decentralized machine learning is a promising emerging paradigm in view of global challenges of data
            ownership and privacy. We consider learning of linear classification and regression models, in the
            setting where the training data is decentralized over many user devices, and the learning algorithm
            must run on-device, on an arbitrary communication network, without a central coordinator. We propose
            COLA, a new decentralized training algorithm with strong theoretical guarantees and superior practical
            performance. Our framework overcomes many limitations of existing methods, and achieves communication
            efficiency, scalability, elasticity as well as resilience to changes in data and participating devices.

            Library that delivers numerical representations (features) for short
            texts or sentences, which can be used as input to any machine
            learning task later on.
